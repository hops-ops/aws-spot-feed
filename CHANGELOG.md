### What's changed in v0.1.2

* chore(makefile): add generate-configuration target (by @patrickleet)

  Wires hops validate generate-configuration as a prerequisite of
  validate:all / validate / validate:% so configuration.yaml is
  regenerated from upbound.yaml before each validation run.

  The `.gitignore` entry was auto-appended by the hops CLI on first
  run — configuration.yaml is a generated artifact.

  Implements [[tasks/update-xrd-makefiles-generate-config]]
